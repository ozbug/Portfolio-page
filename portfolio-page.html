    <p>Web design and developer student at Epicodus in Portland, Oregon. Look 
    through some of my projects and get in touch with any questions.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Ozonnia Onwuzu. I am currently a student at Epicodus. 
    Prior to Epicodus I studied Biology at Adelphi University, NY. I've been 
    on a break from college to gain some personal enrichment and achieve some other 
    life goals. Having a sister and brother as software developers and seeing how they 
    bond over sharing codes and debugging got me interested in programming. Plus, some
    knowledge in programming language wouldn't hurt a career in Bioinformatics. When I'm 
    not learning code I'm usually at the gym, gaming, watching or playing sports or beat 
    making. Here's some of my recent works.</p>
    
    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3><li>Hello World</li></h3>
        <p>This was the <strong>first</strong> webpage I created with the guidance of Epicodus.
        It was a simple page made to say hello to the world in seven languages. It uses HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <h3><li>Goodbye World</li></h3>
        <p>This is a simple page 
        </p>
        <h3><li>My First Webpage</li></h3>

        <h3><li>Branching Website</li></h3>

        <h3><li>Epicodus Band</li></h3>

        <h3><li>Animal Shelter</li></h3>
    </ul>
