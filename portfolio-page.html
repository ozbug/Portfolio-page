    <h1>Hi, I'm Oz</h1>
    <img src="img/not-my-image.jpg" alt="A photo of I relate to.">
    <p>Web design and developer student at Epicodus in Portland, Oregon. Look 
through some of my projects and get in touch with any questions.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Ozonnia Onwuzu. I am currently a student at Epicodus. 
Prior to Epicodus I studied Biology at Adelphi University, NY. I've been 
on a break from college to gain some personal enrichment and achieve some other 
life goals. Having a sister and brother as software developers and seeing how they 
bond over sharing codes and debugging got me interested in programming. Plus, some
knowledge in programming language wouldn't hurt a career in Bioinformatics. When I'm 
not learning code, I'm usually at the gym, gaming, watching or playing sports or beat 
making. Here's some of my recent works.</p>
    
    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3><li>Hello World</li></h3>
        <p>This was the <strong>first webpage</strong> I created with the guidance of Epicodus.
    It was simply made to say hello to the world in seven languages. It uses HTML and CSS.
    <a href="https://github.com/ozbug/hello-world">Here's</a> a link.</p>
        <h3><li>Goodbye World</li></h3>
        <p>This page was also created with the guidance of Epidcodus to say goodbye to the world
    in four different languages. It uses HTML and CSS. <a href="https://github.com/ozbug/goodbye-world">Check</a>
